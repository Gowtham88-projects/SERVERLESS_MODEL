To set up a static website hosting environment using AWS services, follow these steps:

1. Create an S3 Bucket: Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store your website's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Enable static website hosting on this bucket.
 
2. Upload Website Content: Upload your static website files to the S3 bucket.

3. Configure CloudFront: Create a CloudFront distribution with your S3 bucket as the origin. This will serve your content globally with low latency.
 
4. Set Up API Gateway: Use Amazon API Gateway to create RESTful APIs that your website can call for dynamic operations.

5. Develop Lambda Functions: Write AWS Lambda functions to handle the business logic for your APIs.

6. Configure DynamoDB: Set up Amazon DynamoDB tables to store and retrieve application data as needed by your Lambda functions.
 
7. Integrate API Gateway with Lambda: Connect your API Gateway endpoints to the corresponding Lambda functions to process incoming requests.
 
8. Implement CORS Policies: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in API Gateway to allow your website to make API calls from the browser.

9. Set Up Permissions: Ensure that your Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to access DynamoDB and other AWS services.

10. Test and Deploy: Test your setup thoroughly to ensure all components work together seamlessly, then deploy your website.

This architecture leverages S3 for static content, CloudFront for content delivery, API Gateway and Lambda for dynamic processing, and DynamoDB for data storage.
